Concurrency issues are common in modern applications where multiple users interact with the same data. One such issue is when two users try to purchase the last item of a product at the same time. In this blog post, we'll explore how to solve this using database locks in a Spring Boot application with Spring Data JPA and PostgreSQL.

‚ú® Objectives

Understand why database locks are important

Learn how to use pessimistic and optimistic locking in Spring Boot

Demonstrate the problem using a real-world e-commerce example

Solve it using pessimistic locking

Write a test that simulates the issue and proves the fix

üìù The Problem: Race Condition During Purchase

Imagine a scenario where only one unit of a product is left in stock. Two users attempt to purchase it at the same time. If your code looks like this:

@Transactional
public void purchaseProduct(Long productId) {
    // Step 1: Load product from DB
    Product product = productRepository.findById(productId)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Product not found"));

    // Step 2: Check quantity
    if (product.getQuantity() > 0) {
        // Step 3: Reduce and save
        product.setQuantity(product.getQuantity() - 1);
        productRepository.save(product);
    } else {
        throw new RuntimeException("Out of stock");
    }
}

This method is annotated with @Transactional, which ensures that the operations within it are executed in a single transaction. However, this does not prevent concurrent transactions from reading the same value at the same time.

üêû What Goes Wrong?

Let's say:

The database has one unit of Product A.

Thread A and Thread B both invoke purchaseProduct(1) at nearly the same moment.

Here‚Äôs what can happen:

Thread A reads the product and sees quantity = 1.

Thread B does the same before A commits.

Both threads pass the if (quantity > 0) check.

Both reduce quantity by 1 and save.

Now you've sold the same item twice! The DB allows this because no lock was enforced during the findById call.

üîí The Solution: Pessimistic Locking

With pessimistic locking, a row in the database is locked as soon as it is read, preventing other transactions from modifying it until the lock is released.

‚úÖ Update the Repository

public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {

    @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)
    @Query("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.id = :id")
    Optional<Product> findByIdForUpdate(@Param("id") Long id);
}

The @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE) annotation ensures that the database acquires a lock on the row, preventing other transactions from reading or writing to it until the current transaction finishes.

‚úÖ Update the Service Method

@Service
public class ProductService {
    private final ProductRepository productRepository;

    public ProductService(ProductRepository productRepository) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository;
    }

    @Transactional
    public void purchaseProduct(Long productId) {
        // Acquires a DB lock on the row, blocking concurrent access
        Product product = productRepository.findByIdForUpdate(productId)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Product not found"));

        if (product.getQuantity() > 0) {
            product.setQuantity(product.getQuantity() - 1);
            productRepository.save(product);
        } else {
            throw new ProductOutOfStockException("Product is out of stock");
        }
    }
}

This prevents multiple threads from simultaneously reading and modifying the same row, eliminating the overselling issue.

üîç Test: Simulate Concurrency

We simulate two concurrent purchases for the last item in stock. Only one should succeed.

@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD)
public class ProductServiceConcurrencyTest {

    @Autowired
    private ProductRepository productRepository;

    @Autowired
    private ProductService productService;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {
        Product product = new Product();
        product.setName("Test Product");
        product.setQuantity(1);
        productRepository.save(product);
    }

    @Test
    public void testConcurrentPurchaseThrowsOutOfStock() throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        Long productId = productRepository.findAll().get(0).getId();

        List<Future<Exception>> futures = new ArrayList<>();

        Callable<Exception> task = () -> {
            try {
                productService.purchaseProduct(productId);
                return null;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                return e;
            }
        };

        futures.add(executor.submit(task));
        futures.add(executor.submit(task));

        executor.shutdown();
        executor.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        int outOfStockCount = 0;
        for (Future<Exception> future : futures) {
            Exception ex = future.get();
            if (ex instanceof ProductOutOfStockException) {
                outOfStockCount++;
            }
        }

        assertEquals(1, outOfStockCount);
        Product updatedProduct = productRepository.findById(productId).orElseThrow();
        assertEquals(0, updatedProduct.getQuantity());
    }
}

üß† Alternative: Optimistic Locking

Optimistic locking is another approach where a version field is used to detect concurrent modifications. It's great when conflicts are rare and performance is critical. If a conflict is detected, you can retry the operation using @Retryable from Spring Retry.

We won't dive into the code here, but optimistic locking is ideal when you want fast reads and are okay with occasional retries.

üß† Summary

Lock Type

Use When

Notes

Pessimistic Lock

Conflicts are frequent

Uses actual DB row locks

Optimistic Lock

Conflicts are rare, high read volume

Uses versioning, faster, needs retry mechanism

Using Spring Data JPA + Pessimistic Locking, you can reliably handle race conditions. For read-heavy systems with rare conflicts, Optimistic Locking with retry support can be an efficient alternative.

Let me know if you'd like to explore deadlock handling or distributed locking next!
