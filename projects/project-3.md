I build this app while going through Udacity Backend Developer course. 

## Tools and Techs:
- Flask as a backend framework.
- SQLAlchemy ORM: On my machine I was using **Postgress**. While in production and because it's free it I opted for **SQLite**. The **ORM** handles this for you, you can basically use whatever RDBMS and **SQLAlchemy** will handle it.
- Login: Users authentication is provided by Facebook **OAuth**.
